Reflection

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring functionality and security involves thorough unit testing, using test-driven development (TDD) principles, and implementing secure coding practices. I used JUnit tests in my Contact Service project to verify functionality and detect potential errors early.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I analyze requirements, break them down into features, and translate them into code. In the Contact Service project, I implemented constraints such as unique contact IDs and data validation based on given specifications.

How do I approach designing software?
I follow an iterative process: gathering requirements, planning with UML diagrams, writing modular code, and testing thoroughly. The Contact Service project showcases my ability to create maintainable, testable code using object-oriented principles.
